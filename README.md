# Hackdavis Project

Problem Statement: The Aggie Reuse Store currently has no way of monitoring the store's foot traffic, so they do not know how many students come in every week, when the students tend to come in, and what days of the week are most popular. Operating hours change from quarter to quarter, so they want to use customer traffic data to know when the most optimal time to open is and how to better staff their volunteers to support rush hour.
